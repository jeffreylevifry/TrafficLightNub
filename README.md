# Traffic Light

Visual production management solution for controlling workflow and anticipating bottlenecks.

## Background

The print and production end of ARC was having trouble with taking orders / input and managing a reasonable workload between multiple departments. Traffic Light uses a simple color-coded system to indicate how much work is currently in-house and provides ordertakers and salesmen a quick, easy and responsive visual guide to how busy production is in order to give an accurate turnaround estimate.
